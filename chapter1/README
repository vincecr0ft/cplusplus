Perhaps I am showing my age here but I learned to code in fortran. 
Fortran sucks at graphics and at handling strings. 
Fortran and C are very similar. C strings are horrible. 
If you need to modify strings in your code use C++ strings!
Or just use Python! Python is fun!

Anyway for chapter2 I will write a proper README

the only important information needed here:
    g++ -o test test.cc
